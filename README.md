## 🎮 Project Overview

Cyber-Tank Arena: Nomads is an interactive 3D browser game developed using **Three.js** and **JavaScript ES6 modules**.

The player controls a cybernetic tank in a futuristic arena inspired by nomadic culture and steppe landscapes. The objective is to survive increasingly difficult enemy waves, destroy hostile drones, avoid obstacles, and achieve the highest possible score.

The project was developed for the **Interactive Graphics** course and demonstrates the use of:

* Hierarchical modelling
* Multiple light sources
* Procedural texture generation
* User interaction
* Real-time animations
* Collision detection
* Modular game architecture

## 🎨 Graphics Features

### Hierarchical Model

The player tank is implemented as a hierarchical model:

```text
tankGroup
 └── chassis
      ├── wheels
      └── turretGroup
            └── barrelGroup
                  └── muzzleTip
```

This structure allows independent animation of movement, turret rotation, wheel rotation, and barrel recoil.

### Lighting

The project uses four different light sources:

* AmbientLight
* DirectionalLight
* SpotLight (Headlights)
* PointLight (Muzzle Flash)

### Procedural Textures

All textures are generated programmatically using the HTML Canvas API:

* Base Color Map
* Normal Map
* Roughness Map
* Emissive Map
* Ground Texture

---

## 🎥 Animations

The game includes multiple real-time animations:

* Tank movement
* Chassis rotation
* Wheel rotation
* Turret tracking
* Barrel recoil
* Muzzle flash effect
* Enemy movement
* Enemy targeting
* Enemy shooting
* Camera follow system
* Wave announcements

Animations are implemented directly in JavaScript using **Tween.js** where smooth interpolation is required.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

Possible future extensions:

* Sound effects and background music
* Additional enemy types
* Power-ups and upgrades
* Advanced particle effects
* Boss battles
* Multiplayer support
* Physics engine integration
